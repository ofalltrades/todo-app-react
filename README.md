# todo-app-react

simple todo app in React

State is managed via Redux. Styled Components are used for all styling. Styling is intentionally minimal, however, as the focus of this app is programmatic.

### Usage

- Adding todo: type in input field and either click the `+` button or press enter to create a new event
- Striking todo: click text of a todo item
- Delete todo: click red `x` button to the right of todo item
